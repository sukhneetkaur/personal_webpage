## Sukhneet Kaur

I am a Senior at Mount Holyoke College pursuing a Neuroscience major and a Psychology minor with a concentration in Data Science. I am passionate about using various computational and data anaytics techniques to play my part in understanding and untangling the complexities of human brain and behavior.  I have been able to work towards my goal as part of Visual Cognition and Attention Lab at University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where I utilize human eye-tracking data to determine the different search strategies that people use while performing a visual search task. This project seeks to examine the extent to which people are willing to employ their cognitive resources which would further help the research community find ways to optimize visual search.

I have also had the opportunity to tie my neuroscience/ psychology research experience with the industrial domain by completing a ANA Educational Foundation certified program (Marketing and Advertisemnt Education Program) as MADE 2020 summer intern. At the Association for National Advertisers, I had the opportunity to learn directly from executives in the industry who enabled me to see human behavior research in a different light. 

I am currently looking for full-time opportunities in either Industry (Marketing, Data Analytics, Consumer Insights) or Academia (Research Assistant Positions - Neuroscience / Cognitive Psychology Research).

## Projects

### Visual Cognition and Attention Lab, University of Massachusetts

- Worked on re-analyzing human eye-tracking data from prior experiments conducted in the lab to explore how people make decisions and the different search strategies they use during visual search tasks
- Performed data processing, analysis, and visualization of eye-tracking data to explore experimental parameters for optimal target-search strategies in humans (Dataset: ~500 subjects, 400k datapoints, 30 features) (Tools: Excel, RStudio, ggplot)
- Conducted an independent analytical study (honors thesis project) to find the experimental conditions that nudge people towards using more optimal search strategies
- Key findings: subjects tend to use sub-optimal strategies when given a choice in a visual search task, attentional guidance is better when subjects have a prior experience with harder search trials

### Couperus Lab, Mount Holyoke College 

- Processing and analyzing ERP data for multiple projects in lab (Tools: MATLAB)
- Data cleaning using Artifact Correction and Independent Component Analysis to remove noise
- Constructing graphical representations: Time Course Plots, Activity Power Spectrums and Topographic Maps

### Woodard Lab, Mount Holyoke College

- Participated in Independent Project under Prof. Craig Woodard to study if Gal-4 system is an effective way of tracking programmed cell death (PCD) of ptilinal head muscles in Drosophila melanogaster
- Examined the difference in the pattern and timing of death of the ptilinal head muscles, between transgenic (Dmef-Gal4, UAS-RFP) and wild type (CS) flies, of different age groups
- Performed dissections under microscope and took tissue images using stereoscopy (Nikon SMZ-1500)
- Processed and analyzed data with ImageJ and SPSS
- Concluded that Gal-4 system is not an effective way to study PCD of ptilinal head muscles in fruit flies

### Understanding Cognition Research, Mount Holyoke College

- Conducted a group project to investigate how individual differences such as handedness and reaction time may affect the amplitude of N2pc, under the supervision of Prof. Jane Couperus
- ERP data of 129 participants (age 18 – 30) was taken from an ongoing project at Couperus Lab
- The N2pc was examined in visual search task where 12 items were presented to the left visual field and 12 items were presented to the right visual field.
- ERP data was analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA
- Concluded that processing speed is correlated to the N2pc attentional effect component. However, handedness was not found to influence the amplitude of N2pc

### Genetics Research, Mount Holyoke College

- Investigated the correlation between skin and hair pigmentation and the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in the MSH (Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone) in different subjects
- Conducted lab experiments to isolate MC1R through the amplification of the protein-coding region of the MC1R gene using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and the separation of this region through gel electrophoresis
- The NCBI’s BLAST search engine was used to compare the sequences with those in NCBI’s gene database to make sure that the correct region of the human genome was amplified and was further used to identify the SNPs and the corresponding MC1R amino acid variants (if any) using sequence analysis software.

### Cell Biology Research, Mount Holyoke College

- Studied impact of Nocodazole and Taxol on microtubular and mitochondrial distribution in pig cells (LLC-PK1 GFPtubulin) under the supervision of Prof. Craig Woodard
- The study used LLC-PK1α, a modified version of the normal Lewis Lung Carcinoma Procine Kidney (LLC-PK1) epithelial cell line
- GFP (green florescent protein) is attached to the α-tubulin in these cells making the microtubules florescent green, to enable florescence imaging
- Cells were also stained with Mito-tracker Red to visualize the mitochondrial distribution
- Blue excitor and green barrier filters on a compound microscope were used to visualize the microtubules while the mitochondrial distribution was visualized using the green excitor and red barrier filters
- Key Findings:
        - Cells treated with Taxol depicted more condensed tubulin molecules and microtubules were present closer to the nucleus
        - Microtubules in the cells treated with Nocodazole were more dispersed and present away from the nucleus
        - Neither Taxol nor Nocodazole influenced the mitochondrial distribution
      
### Statistics Research, Mount Holyoke College

- Conducted an independent analytical study under Prof. Marie Ozanne to explore the different factors impacting the nitrogen dioxide concentration in air, using multiple regression model
- The data for this study was taken from a Norwegian study on air pollution, conducted at Alnabru in Oslo, Norway from October 2001 to August 2003
- Used ‘all subsets regression’ to compare the performance of different statistical models, after quantifying the performance using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
- Key Findings:
         - The NO2 concentration was found to be positively correlated with the number of cars per hour on a particular road, temperature difference between 2 and 5 meters above ground, wind direction, and number of days from October 1, 2001
         - The NO2 concentration was found to be negatively correlated with the air temperature 2 meters above ground and wind speed
